# CS/IMGD 420x: Graphical Simulation of Physical Systems

This course focuses on the digital simulation of physical systems and strategies for interactive representation. Topics include:

- Parallel computing on graphics processing units (GPUs)  
- Realtime graphics techniques  
- The history of analog interactive visuals  
- Interaction techniques for controlling digital simulations  

Students will explore analog physical systems (such as fluids and video feedback) and use these explorations to guide the development of digital simulations. All students will be expected to maintain a course website that contains links to all assignments. Videos should be posted to "permanent" locations (Vimeo, YouTube etc.) and embedded / linked in your course website. Details on this website can be found in the [onboarding assignment](). 

## Course Outline

As this is an experimental course being taught for the first time; as such this outline is subject to change. I am happy to make minor additions if there are related topics of interest that are not menttioned here.

### Week 1: Getting Started / Review
1/15 - *Basic Intro to WebGL / Shader programmming*. Assignment:  Complete the [onboarding assignment](). Both are due 1/17 (the second day of class).  
1/16 - *GLSL waveforms and GLSL Live Coding*. Assignment: 
I. Read / experiment with [http://thebookofshaders.com](The Book of Shaders) up through the lesson on [https://thebookofshaders.com/11/](Noise)  
II. Create a one-minute animation using Shawn Lawson's [https://shawnlawson.github.io/The_Force/](The Force) environment. Your animation can be through-composed (no interaction) or performed via live-coding or other interaction techniques (mouse etc.). Post a link to your animation along with your shader code to your course website.   

### Week 2: Analog / Digital Video Synthesis, Rendering to Textures
1/20 - *History and Techniques of Analog Video Synthesis*. Assignment: Complete the analog synthesis (Vidiot) tutorial. Create a one minute video showing an interesting parameter space you found to explore using the Vidiot. Work towards recreating this sketch in GLSL, by implementing a minimum of eight Vidiot features. Some of these will be simple (noise, modulation) some will be trickier (video input, waveforms, audio input).  
1/23 - *Video input / processing, Analog video feedback, no-input performances*.  

### Week 3: Automata, Reaction Diffusion, and Rendering to Texttures
1/27 - 1D / 2D Automata, Rendering to Texture
1/30 - Reaction Diffusion, Convolution

### Week 4: Video feedback + Rendering to Texture
2/3 - 
2/7 - TBA (I'll be at [http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/2020/schedule.html](ICLC)).

### Week 5: Perlin Flows, Navier-Stokes, and other Fluid Simulations
2/10 - Guest lecture with [Alexander Dupuis](http://alexanderdupuis.com/) on performing with video feedback systems. Perlin Flows  
2/13 - Navier-Stokes and other fluid simulations  

### Week 6: Interaction in Digital Arts
2/17 - Guest lecture with [https://creativecoding.soe.ucsc.edu/angus/](Angus Forbes) on interacting with fluid simulations  
2/20 - OSC / MIDI / Mapping strategies for digital arts practice  

### Week 7: CUDA & OpenCL 
2/24 - Libraries for computing on the GPU  
2/27 - NO CLASS: Academic Advising Day  
2/28 - READING / MAKEUP DAY  

### Week 8: Final Project Presentations &amp; Wrapup  
3/2 - Wrap-up, preliminary final project critiques 
3/5 - Final Project Presentations  

# Grades
Your course grade comes from three parts:

Assignments (50%)
Final Project (40%)
Quizzes and in-class assignments (10%)

There will most likely be 4–5 assignments in the course in addition to the final project. I reserve the right to adjust the above if needed. 

I don’t accept late homework, doing so is unfair to your fellow students and to course staff. It is much better to submit partially complete work than nothing at all. If you don’t have the homework done on time you will receive a zero for that assignment. You are expected to complete the assignment and have it deployed by the due date.
